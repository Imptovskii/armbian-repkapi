# Armbian for RepkaPi
Небольшой проект по портированию Armbian. В данный момент проект находит в активной стадии разработки.
Первые рабочие билды уже лежат в релизах. Есть небольшие шараховатости но уже все более или менее работает.

### для сборки подтребуется:

- Ubuntu 22.04 Server
- От 4 потоков (начиная с семейства Sandy/Ivy Bridge) для более или менее быстрой сборки
- От 2 ГБ ОЗУ

### Как собрать Armbian?

```
apt-get -y install git
git clone --branch=main https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

Затем ищем в списке repkapi3 и задаем параметры которые нам нужны.

### Копируем DTB в /boot img образа.

/path/to/build/ - это путь до папки со сборщиком

```
sudo kpartx -av /path/to/build/armbian-repkapi/output/images/<Образ>.img
```

Затем вам программа kpartx выстаст название устройства напимер /dev/loop1p1. Только у вас будет уже своя цифра (/dev/loop1p1, /dev/loop2p1 и т.д.).

```
sudo mount -o loop /dev/mapper/loop<цифра>p1 /mnt/img/
sudo cp /path/to/build/armbian-repkapi/cache/sources/u-boot/v2022.07-repka/arch/arm/dts/sun50i-h5-repka-pi3.dtb /mnt/img/boot/dtb-5.15.93-sunxi64/allwinner/
sudo umount /mnt/img
```

- Interactive graphical interface.
- The workspace will be prepared by installing the necessary dependencies and sources.
- It guides the entire process until a kernel package or ready-to-use image of the SD card is created.

### Build parameter examples

Show work in progress areas in interactive mode:

```bash
./compile.sh EXPERT="yes"
```

Build minimal CLI Armbian Focal image for Orangepi Zero. Use modern kernel and write image to the SD card:

```bash
./compile.sh \
BOARD=orangepizero \
BRANCH=current \
RELEASE=focal \
BUILD_MINIMAL=yes \
BUILD_DESKTOP=no \
KERNEL_ONLY=no \
KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no \
CARD_DEVICE="/dev/sdX"
```
